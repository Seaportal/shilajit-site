        <h2>Geographical Origins of Authentic Shilajit</h2>
        <p>Genuine Shilajit is primarily found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,000 and 5,000 meters. The most renowned sources include:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Himalayan Range:</strong> Spanning India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet - considered the most traditional source</li>
          <li><strong>Altai Mountains:</strong> Extending across Russia, Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan</li>
          <li><strong>Caucasus Mountains:</strong> Between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea</li>
          <li><strong>Andes Mountains:</strong> Less common but found in certain regions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Each geographical source produces Shilajit with slightly different mineral compositions, reflecting the unique geology of each region.</p>
        
        <h2>The Formation Process</h2>
        <p>Authentic Shilajit forms through a centuries-long process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Plant matter becomes trapped between layers of rock in mountainous regions</li>
          <li>Over centuries, the organic material undergoes transformation due to microbial action and pressure</li>
          <li>The resulting substance is compressed and enriched with minerals from the surrounding rocks</li>
          <li>During warm months, the substance seeps from cracks in the rocks as a resin-like material</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Identifying Authentic Shilajit</h2>
        <p>Here are key characteristics of genuine Shilajit:</p>
        
        <h3>Physical Properties:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Color:</strong> Ranges from dark brown to blackish, sometimes with a reddish or golden hue</li>
          <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Soft and pliable when warm, hard and brittle when cold</li>
          <li><strong>Solubility:</strong> Dissolves completely in warm water, turning the water a rich brown color without leaving significant residue</li>
          <li><strong>Taste:</strong> Distinctly bitter and earthy with a characteristic smell</li>
          <li><strong>Shine:</strong> Authentic resin has a slight shine when freshly broken</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Red Flags for Fake Products:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Perfectly uniform color and texture</li>
          <li>Sweet or pleasant taste (often masked with additives)</li>
          <li>Failure to dissolve completely in warm water</li>
          <li>Unusually low price (quality Shilajit is labor-intensive to harvest and process)</li>
          <li>No information about source or testing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Laboratory Testing for Quality</h2>
        <p>Reputable Shilajit products should undergo rigorous testing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Heavy Metal Testing:</strong> To ensure safety and purity</li>
